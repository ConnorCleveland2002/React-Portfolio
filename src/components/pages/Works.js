            <p>
              Fun Finder was a group project, in which the goal was to
              successfully use an API to create a functional web application. We
              decided as a group to create an application centred around getting
              people who fele locked up at home during Covid outside and doing
              some events. So, we designed an interface where users can select
              their location, add their interests by keyword or category, and a
              few other constraints, and then they recieve a list of events that
              matcdh up with the user input. From there, users can save certain
              events they find interesting and go to their saved page to view
              their saved events in a carousel.

            </a>
            <p>
              Weather Dashboard's goal was to get a week's forecast on a certain
              location, and to get weather-related data on the location for the
              whole week. Users can input their location or use a custom
              location in the search field, and a return will come from the
              search giving back Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, and UV Index,
              as well as an image relating to the weather of that area dependant
              on the current conditions in that area. This was a solo
              assignment, and one I had allot of fun creating.

            <p>
              Note-Taker-inator's goal was to create a note-taking programme,
              and allow users to create and store their notes on a deployed
              site. This was a solo projects, and included a user being able to
              add a new note with a title and contents, then being able to save
              on their local machine the notes that they took, as well as the
              ability to be able to delete any notes they had taken but didn't
              need anymore. Perhaps ina future build, one might be able to
              export these notes as text files, or save them to one's machine
              for future use.

            <p>
              Password Generator-inator's goal was to create a button that
              allows users to create a unique password based on constraints
              outlined by themselves. This was a rather simple project that
              demonstrates a button generating a string. Using this application,
              one can generate their password for future uses, and perhaps in a
              future build qwill be able to name and save their passwords to the
              application.

            <p>
              Handlebars Portfolio's task was to create an updated portfolio
              with technologies such as handlebars, bootstrap, and others to
              create an up-to-date looking and functioning portfolio. With this
              updated portfolio, employers can see the current technologies I am
              capable of, and have a taste of just a few of my skills I've
              learnt through my career. In the future, this react portfolio will
              serve a my personal website, but even later that may change into
              more advanced technologies.

            </a>
            <p>
              Daily Scheduler's task was to create an application to schedule
              certain events through the day, see what hour of the day it is,
              and see which hours have passed. For this application, grey served
              as hours passed, green are hours to come, and red was the current
              hour. Users can save a note to any time slot in the day, and it
              will change which one is active based on what time of the day it
              is. This simple tracker was one of the first applications I'd ever
              created, and it goes to show how far I've come from that point.
